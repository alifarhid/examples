# Generic CPU project

This project provides a simple single workspace machine, usually to run Python and Jupyter from. It does not include a Dask cluster for distributed computing by default, but that can be added from the project page of the Saturn GUI. There is no GPU associated with this worker either--if you want GPU computing (either on the workspace machine or for an attached dask cluster) use the generic GPU project instead.
