# Distributed Computing Quickstart

This project lets you quickly get starting running computations across multiple systems using Dask. The project is set up to have a single workspace instance (which is hosting this notebook), and three additional Dask workers for doing distributed computations. To get started with dask, check out the [start-with-dask.ipybnb](start-with-dask.ipybnb) notebook, which shows how you can take a parallelizable Python function and run it on multiple systems at once.
