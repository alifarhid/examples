# Train an TensorFlow model with R on a GPU

This example uses the reticulate, keras, and tensorflow packages of R to train a model on a GPU.
To run it, use the `saturn-rstudio-tensorflow` image. If you would rather train it on a CPU you
can instead use the `saturn-rstudio` image and manually install the R and Python Keras and TensorFlow
packages.
