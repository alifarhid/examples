    "## Overview\n",
    "[Prefect Cloud](https://www.prefect.io/cloud/) is a hosted, high-availability, fault-tolerant service that handles all the orchestration responsibilities for running data pipelines. It gives you complete oversight of your workflows and makes it easy to manage them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses Dask operations directly (creating Dask DataFrames) , utilizing prefect ResourceManager. We will then register this flow with Prefect Cloud so that service can be used for orchestrating when the flow runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Details\n",
    "For this example we will be using famous NYC taxi dataset. This dataset contains information about taxi trips in New York City. For the purposes of this example, we will be looking at the yellow taxi data from January 2019. We are distributing a single task amongst dask clusters. The task includes reading the datafrom nyc taxi dataset, filtering out the rows where price is missing and then calculating amount of variation in passenger count.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Modelling Process\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "* created a Prefect Cloud account\n",
    "* set up the appropriate credentials in Saturn\n",
    "* set up a Prefect Cloud agent in Saturn Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "Details on these prerequisites can be found in [Using Prefect Cloud with Saturn Cloud](https://saturncloud.io/docs/using-saturn-cloud/prefect_cloud/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in this example uses prefect for orchestration (figuring out what to do, and in what order) and Dask Cluster for execution (doing the things).\n",
    "\n",
    "It relies on the following additional non-builtin libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `dask-saturn`: create and interact with Saturn Cloud `Dask` clusters ([link](https://github.com/saturncloud/dask-saturn))\n",
    "* `prefect-saturn`: register Prefect flows with both Prefect Cloud and  Saturn Cloud.\n"
