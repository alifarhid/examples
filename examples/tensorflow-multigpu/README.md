# TensorFlow 

**Note: Due to the large hardware required for this example, it only runs on Saturn Cloud Pro and Saturn Cloud Enterprise.**

This is an example for running TensorFlow training tasks on multiple GPUs inside of Saturn Cloud. It uses a single large resource with many GPUs attach to concurrently train a model. The example is contained in [multi-gpu-tensorflow.ipynb](multi-gpu-tensorflow.ipynb).

To train a model with a single GPU in TensorFlow, see the single GPU TensorFlow example on the Saturn Cloud docs.
