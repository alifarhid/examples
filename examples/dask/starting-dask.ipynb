The Python library `dask_saturn` is pre-installed on Saturn Cloud resources and used for connecting to Saturn Cloud Dask clusters. By default this will start a Dask cluster with the same settings that you have already set in the Saturn UI (and the specific number of workers). The `wait_for_workers()` command will halt the notebook execution until all of the workers are ready."
