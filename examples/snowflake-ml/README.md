# Machine Learning on Unstructured Data with Saturn Cloud and Snowflake
## Supplementary Materials

Welcome! This repository contains scripts to accompany our guide to using Snowflake and Saturn Cloud together for machine learning on unstructured data (in this case, image files). 

* Model training: [training.py](training.py)
* Parallelize inference on Dask: [inference.ipynb](inference.ipynb)
* PyTorch data class for Snowflake stored image files: [pytorch_snowflake_class.py](pytorch_snowflake_class.py)

Use these files along with our full guide on the Snowflake website.
