# PyTorch Quickstart

This project provides the basics for using PyTorch on Saturn Cloud. Here are some examples to get started:



## [Use Pytorch on a single GPU](01-start-with-pytorch.ipynb)

This workbook gives an example of how to train a PyTorch neural network with a GPU by training a LSTM to generate pet names.

## [Start running code in parallel with Dask](02-start-with-dask.ipynb)

This workbook shows a basic example of how you can parallelize code with a Dask cluster.

## [Use Pytorch to train across multiple GPUs in parallel with Dask](03-start-with-pytorch+dask.ipynb)

By combining Pytorch with Dask you can train a neural network over many different GPUs at once. This example uses the same pet names example as the single-GPU notebook.
